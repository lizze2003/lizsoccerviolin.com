    <p><ins>Sam's Story:</ins><br>Sam Peterson is something 
      of a neat-freak. He has always wanted things nice and neat and
      pretty particular about things being in order. His parents always
      teasted that maybe he should be a housekeeper when he grows up. He
      took the serious and started working on cleaning houses as a side
      job. It was only enough to be a part-time work until last year in
      2016 when he finally hired s staff and started cleaning houses full
      time.
